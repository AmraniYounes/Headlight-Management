# Headlight Management Software Architecture in Simulink using AUTOSAR Blockset

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Headlight Management** software architecture in Simulink, utilizing the **AUTOSAR Blockset**. The objective is to design and simulate the system's architecture, including Software Components (SWCs), their ports and interfaces, and calls to Basic Software (BSW) services to achieve the desired headlight management functionality.

## Key Features
- Implementation of **AUTOSAR-compliant Software Components (SWCs)**.
- Definition of **ports** and **interfaces** for SWC communication.
- Integration of **Basic Software (BSW)** service calls to support system functionality.
- Simulation of the complete system architecture within Simulink.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Simulink**: For model-based design and simulation.
- **AUTOSAR Blockset**: For creating AUTOSAR-compliant software architecture.
- **MATLAB/Simulink** Version: [Specify your version here].
